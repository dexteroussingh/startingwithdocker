Follow the commands here:
docker container run -it : starts new container interactively
docker container exec -it: run additonal command in existing container
Alpine Linux distribution:
docker container run -it alpine bash :(Will give us an error as alpine linux does not container bash shell because of being very small in size) 
docke container run -it alpine sh : this will run a sh shell for us inside alpine linux and hence we can see the usage through ~# apk (enter)
